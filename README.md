# Manager

If you are a developer, chances are that you have a half-dozen or so side projects in various stages of completion. The goal of Manager is to help you, well, _manage_ your projects.

# Features
- Automatically add new projects by setting the "All Projects Directory" under Settings->Configure.
- Change the name displayed in the project list (defaults to the top-level directory name).
- Specify projects to exclude from the list of projects.
- Show the last _x_ number of git commits (requires Git to be installed).
- Open a project in the appropriate editor (requires either the default installation path, or a custom path to be set under Settings->Launchers).
 - Supported editors: Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2019, Android Studio, Unity Hub.
- Open projects in File Explorer.
- Display a timestamp of the last update in the given directory (the date format can be changed under Settings->Configure).
